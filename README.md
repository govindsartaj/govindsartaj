# Hi! My name is Govind

👉 he/him/his

I'm a software engineer based in the U.S. (but I'm open and excited to live anywhere!). I will graduate from Grinnell College with a Computer Science degree in May 2021.

Recently, I have been doing a lot of full stack development with Javascript and PHP while working as an intern at [College Kickstart](https://www.collegekickstart.com/). Last summer, I was a machine learning intern with [amplio.ai](http://amplio.ai/), and built/tested neural networks with Python. I pay a lot of attention to detail, and am obsessed with customer-focused development. Drop me a line if you have a cool project, or know of a role that might fit me!
